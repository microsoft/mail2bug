               - MessageBodyWithSender - Similar to MessageBody, but with an added line at the bottom mentioning the
                 display name and email address of the sender. Useful to include indication of the person whose email
                 triggered the work item creation
               - RawMessageBody - The raw body of the email - i.e. if it's an HTML message, this would be the full

               - Today - Current date in short date format ("d")
               - Sender - The name of the sender, resolved against the list of names recognized by TFS. If resolution fails
                          this would resolve to the sender display name.
               - Location - In case the email is a meeting invite, the location of the meeting; empty string otherwise.
               - StartTime - In case the email is a meeting invite, the meeting start time; empty string otherwise.
               - EndTime - In case the email is a meeting invite, the meeting end time; empty string otherwise.

             One recommneded way for using this is to define mnemonics for common actions like resolving/closing/reactivating

             processing.
             
             There are two types supported: 
             - 'EWSByRecipients' (recommended) 
             - 'EWSByFolder'

             'EWSByRecipients' - mail2bug will monitor the 'Inbox' of the mailbox and will process all the items where
             one of the recipients specified in the 'Recipients' element (below) is in the 'To' or 'CC' lines.
             For a setup where the mailbox is serving a single instance, 'Recipients' would be empty and all items in
             the inbox would be processed.
             For setups where you want to serve multiple instances on a single mailbox, you can create other email addresses
             that lead to the same mailbox and define which instance should pick each message by specifying the relevant
             email address in the 'Recipients' element 

             'EWSByFolder' - mail2bug will monitor a specific folder under the root of the mailbox. In this setup, you
             create (server side) exchange rules to route incoming emails to the correct folder.
             Note that the folders need to be directly under the root of the mailbox rather than under 'Inbox'. 
             The folder name to monitor is specified by the 'IncomingFolder' element
             The reason for this method being less preferable is that it involves extra steps for creating exchange rules,
             which can be quite cumbersome. Also, exchange rules can be flaky at times, especially if you have a lot of them
             defined. -->

             folders rather than deleted. Successfully processed messages get moved to the CompletedFolder, while ones
             for which we encountered an error are moved to the ErrorFolder.

             If either of these two elements are missing, we default back to deleting messages after processing them.
